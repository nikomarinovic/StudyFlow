# StudyFlow

A **privacy-first weekly study planner** for students. Organize your study schedule, add exams and project reminders, view a dynamic weekly calendar with event counts, and track your progress — all data is stored locally or synced with **Firebase** for authentication and persistence.

## 🚧 Under Construction

**Note:** StudyFlow is still in early development.

- Currently, there is a **fully functional local version** integrated with **Firebase authentication and database**, but it is **not yet publicly deployed**.  
- The public version showcases the redesigned UI for authentication, dashboard, calendar, and timer pages.  
- All main features—adding events, generating study plans, tracking study sessions, and notifications—are **already implemented locally** and will be rolled out to users soon.
